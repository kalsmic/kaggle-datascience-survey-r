# Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey (R version)

## Project Description

This is my solution of the project from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

The goal is to discover what top tools Kaggle participants use for data science and machine learning.

For that, we will explore the dataset using the `tidyverse` package.

## Prerequisites

It would help if you know

* the basics of R
* a bit about Jupyter Notebooks
* a bit about the `tidyverse` package
* using the terminal/shell

## Getting set up

You can set up this project locally or using Binder.

### Getting set up locally

#### 1. Clone the repository

You can do so by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/vdbcyril/kaggle-datascience-survey-r.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the zip file of the repository at the top of the main page of the repository.

#### 2. Download Anaconda (if needed)

If you do not already have the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python 3, go download it.

#### 3. Create your conda environment

Navigate to the directory `kaggle-datascience-survey-r` and install the required packages in a new conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a new environment called kaggle-datascience-survey-r. To activate the environment, execute:

```
source activate kaggle-datascience-survey-r
```

#### 4. Open the Jupyter Notebook

In the terminal, execute `jupyter notebook`.

Next, open the notebook `kaggle-datascience-survey-r.ipynb` and you are ready to read about the project.
